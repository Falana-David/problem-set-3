As a developer using the Marketplace,
I want a centralized “Create an Agent” onboarding page
so that I understand the standardized process for building, registering, and publishing an agent within the enterprise ecosystem.

This page will serve as the official Marketplace entry point for new agent creation and onboarding. It will guide developers step-by-step through:

Building an agent using the Lingo Agent ADK

Preparing required metadata

Registering the agent in the Registry

Understanding the 2-step registration process

Publishing the agent to the Marketplace

Next steps after registration (e.g., access approval, Playground eligibility)

The page is informational and instructional only. It does not perform agent creation directly. It links to required repositories, documentation, and onboarding workflows.

This feature ensures:

Standardized onboarding

Reduced confusion

Alignment with enterprise architecture

Proper governance before Marketplace listing
