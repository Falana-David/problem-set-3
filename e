Redesign the Marketplace home page to look like a clean, modern developer dashboard instead of a marketing landing page.

We are ONLY redesigning the Marketplace home screen. Do not modify Registry, Agent Management, or Client Dashboard pages.

The goal is to make the page structured, minimal, and focused on agent discovery and action.

Please make the following changes:

Replace the large “Welcome to LingoAI Registry” banner with a smaller, clean header section:

Title: “Marketplace”

Subtitle: “Discover and explore enterprise AI agents.”

Remove marketing language.

Reduce vertical height of the hero section.

Add a compact statistics panel on the right side of the header showing:

Total Agents

Public Agents

Private Agents

Recently Updated

Keep it minimal and professional.

Add a “Primary Actions” section directly under the header with three evenly spaced action cards:

Browse Agents

Publish Agent

Create an Agent (links to onboarding page)

Each card should contain:

Icon

Title

Short one-line description

Button

Keep the design simple and clean.

Add a “Featured Agents” or “Recently Added Agents” section below Primary Actions:

Display agents in a clean grid layout.

Each agent card must show:

Agent Name

Short Description

Version

Owner

Public/Private badge

“View Details” button

Include a “View All” link at the top right of the section.

Add a search bar and simple filter chips above the agent grid:

Search by agent name or capability

Filter chips:

Public

Private

My Agents

Recently Updated

Remove the entire “Key Features” marketing section (Secure Registration, Fast Performance, Scalable Architecture). The Marketplace page should not contain promotional feature cards.

Ensure consistent spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy.

Use a card-based layout.

Avoid oversized gradients.

Keep colors neutral and professional.

Make it feel similar to AWS Console or Azure Portal dashboards.

Ensure the layout is fully responsive and accessible.

The Marketplace home page should feel like a control center for discovering and interacting with agents — not a product marketing page.

Focus on clarity, structure, and usability.
